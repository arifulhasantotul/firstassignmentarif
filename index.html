<!-- 1.1 Coconut Ranch Kale Salad : The best salads are loaded with roasted veggies and topped with a creamy dressing. This vegan coconut ranch is absolutely irresistible. (Seriously, you'll want to dip everything in it.) But the crunchy chickpeas may just be our favorite part. Who needs croutons? 

1.2 Vegan Tacho salad : Our favorite taco salad got a vegan makeover. Filled with grains and two different types of beans, it's a filling salad worthy of your dinner table. The spicy dressing brings tons of flavor and is our favorite part of the salad. Top it will all of your favorites like cherry tomatoes and tortilla chips for a little crunch! 

1.3 Wacky Cake : If you think dessert has to revolve around eggs and dairy, think again. Born out of scarcity during the Great Depression and wartime rationing, wacky cake—also known as crazy cake, depression cake, war cake, and poor man's cake—calls for none of those classical ingredients, is impressively easy to make, and addictively delicious. -->
